# MobileGame

After I finished my Unity course, I got interest to C# and Unity. This is made from mobile perspective. I transformed it to my phone and i got the raycast "technology" work after spending many hours for it. This project doesn't include any other game mechanics than moving on the terrain. It includes some obstacles to test colliding with.
